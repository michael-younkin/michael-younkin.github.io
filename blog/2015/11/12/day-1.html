    <p>While working on implementing a simple regular expression compiler in rust (based on a project for a class I TA for), I found the need to use a global atomic counter variable in order to generate unique IDs. What I thought would be as simple as calling some instruction like fetch_add ended up leading me down a rabbit hole into the world of CPU memory ordering.</p>

<p>You see, while Rust does provide variables accessible only with atomic operations on types in <code>std::sync::atomic</code>, all of the function calls take a value of type <code>std::sync::atomic::Ordering</code>, which tells the compiler what kind of memory order restrictions to apply. I had never heard of anything like a "memory ordering", so I went on StackOverflow and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30407121/which-stdsyncatomicordering-to-use">this question</a>, which at the time had been unanswered for several months.</p>

<p>For some reason, it's pretty difficult to find information online on the subject. One of the best resources is <a href="http://preshing.com/">Jeff Phreshing's blog</a>. He seems to have a knack for understanding and explaining lock-free programming methods, among other things. His best explanation of the issue is <a href="http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations/">this post</a>, which uses source control as an analogy to explain what's going on. Another great resource is <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order">the documentation for C++'s atomic memory orders</a> which are similar to Rust's (likely because GCC and LLVM implement these memory orderings in a similar way).</p>

<p>You can read my answer to the question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30407121/which-stdsyncatomicordering-to-use/33293463#33293463">here</a>, in which I've tried to provide a summary of what the different orderings are and when they're useful.</p>
